    <h1 class='about'> So, Who Am I? </h1>
    <h3 class='about'>I have been interested in art and design for as far as I can remember (4th grade, but who's keeping track?).
        Starting with drawing comic book characters by tracing (hey, I was learning okay?), my skills only evolved from there. 
        I have dipped my hand in a multitude of mediums: illustration, graphic design, UI/UX design, video editing, and many more. 
        Currently, I have a deep focus creating digital content, from the many expressive moments that can be experienced in photography,
         to the unlocking of what my imagination has had stored for so long in graphic design.</h3>
